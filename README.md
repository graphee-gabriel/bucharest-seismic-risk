This application was built to provide a quick way to find out the seismic risk category of a building in Bucharest, from its address, and other details provided by the townhall.
The current data are based on the townhall list released in 2018. In other word, this application is a simpler way to browse this list.

It is important to understand that the absence of a building on this list is in no way a garranty that this building is safe. On the contrary, it only means it was never expertised and we have no information about its safety.
While there is no such thing as 'Risk 0' The higher in the RS category, the safer the building should be.

About the 'Urgenta' system, it was in place for the 2-3 first years. It is not always linked to the iminent danger posed by a building.
It was made to define which building was going to be re-inforced first, funded by state-money.
The fact that this program was then cancelled, on top of many suspicions of bribery to be the first to beneficiate of this state-funded program, make the Urgenta system close to null.
While we kept this information, it can be considerate as this building was not expertised, and should be investigated again with the newer RS system.

This Application was made by Gabriel Morin with the help of Jeremy de France.
